    A simple tool to ease some tasks with CVS working directories

This tool provides, at the moment, two tasks that you may need:

* disconnect (delete the CVS directory) your working directories from the CVS repository;
* change the CVS root of your working directories, so you can checkout files from one CVS root configuration, and later change it to another, useful for example, if you checkout a project inside your company's network and later wants to externally access the company's CVS repository.
